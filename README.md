How to Use
1. Landing Form:
Name Field: The user enters their name.
Email Field: The user provides their email address.
Message Field: The user can leave a message or inquiry.
Submit Button: After completing the form, the user can submit it.
2. Form Validation:
JavaScript validates that the user has filled in all fields before allowing form submission.
You can add your own functionality for handling form submissions (e.g., integrating with a backend).
JavaScript Validation
The form includes basic validation using JavaScript to ensure that:

The name field is not empty.
The email field contains a valid email address format.
The message field is filled out.
You can find the validation code in the script.js file.

Customization
CSS Styles: The layout and appearance can be modified by editing the style.css file.
JavaScript: If you want to add more complex validation or integrate the form with a backend (e.g., to send form data to an email or database), you can modify the script.js file.
Future Enhancements
Add real-time validation for email formatting.
Integrate with a backend service (e.g., using PHP, Node.js, etc.) to store or send form data.
Add success or error messages after form submission.
